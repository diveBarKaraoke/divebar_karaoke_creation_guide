YouTube Movie Maker
===================

`YouTube Movie Maker <https://www.makeyoutubevideo.com/karaokevideosmaker.html>`_ is a video editor (not affiliated with Google/YouTube) that has a karaoke function built into it called Karaoke Video Maker. It has a free version, but high resolution output as well as some features require a paid upgrade. It is a bit harder to sync lyrics, hence the reason some people run the initial sync in KBS then convert, but it allows for visual fine-tuning of the karaoke scroll and a lot of flexibility for layout and load-in effects.
