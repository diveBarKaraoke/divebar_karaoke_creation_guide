Video Output
------------

You may have noticed CDG has a resolution of 300x216, which looks really blocky and outdated on today's high-resolution screens. Sadly, the video output option in KBS will not help with this. It merely enlarges the blocky pixels instead of scaling the text properly.

One solution is to use kbp2video.
