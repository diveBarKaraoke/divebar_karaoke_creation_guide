Welcome!
========

This is a guide for members of the `diveBar Discord <https://discord.gg/diveBar>`_ who are interested in creating karaoke tracks. We hope it will help you get started making your own tracks and join the 100+ creators in our community. If you are not a member of the Discord, feel free to use this resource as well, but note that there may be some references to the Discord throughout it.

If you ever get confused or need clarification about any information in this guide, please reach out with questions in the `#bar channel <https://discord.com/channels/918644502128885760/918644502128885763>`_ and someone who can help will almost always be available.

.. note::
   This guide is not currently comprehensive, but it should point to enough external documentation and tutorial videos to fill in any of the gaps it has.

None of this would not be possible without the work of several diveBar community members. See :doc:`contributors`.
