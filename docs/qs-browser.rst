Getting Started
---------------

Go to `The Tüül <https://the-tuul.com/>`_. We will be creating the whole video using this site, which has both a desktop and mobile interface.

Upload Song
-----------

1. Click the Song File tab at the left and upload the original song, in as high quality as possible.
2. The Tüül will try to auto-detect the artist and title. If they are wrong, correct them. This info is displayed at the start of the track in the output video.
3. The Tüül will process the file in the background while you work on the other steps.

Finally, click the Add Underscores button in the UI so syncing will operate word by word instead of a line at a time.

Syncing Track
-------------

1. Switch to the Song Timing tab and hit Play to start syncing.
2. Tap space bar on your keyboard as each syllable starts and enter at the end of a word when there is a long gap between words.
3. At the very end of the lyrics, hit Enter to finalize the sync.

Video Output
------------

1. Go to the Submit tab and you can preview the sync. It will still play the unseparated audio.
2. If you are satisfied, hit the Create Video button and it will finish processing (may take a few minutes) and provide you with a zip file containing the mp4 file as well as some additional files you can disregard for now.
3. Extract the mp4 file from the zip.
