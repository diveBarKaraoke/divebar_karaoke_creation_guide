Loading Bars
============

Special characters can be added to your karaoke creation file in lieu of lyrics to mimic loading bars or count-ins for use at the start of tracks or during instrumental breaks. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some useful unicode characters. These will not work with every font but should usually work with something standard like Arial or Times New Roman. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters

Full Line
---------

Full lines can be used to pass the time when there is a break between lyrics lasting longer than ten seconds in order to ensure that the screen isn’t just blank. Usually used in conjunction with an indication of the amount of time until the singer will be singing again. 

e.g. :30 BREAK – Full Line Character

Half Line 
---------

Half lines can be used to indicate a short break during a section with lyrics to help ensure the singer has proper timing especially when the lyrics in question are different from the normal timing or rhythm elsewhere in the song.
