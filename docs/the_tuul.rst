The Tüül
========

`The Tüül <https://the-tuul.com/>`_ is a free web-based karaoke creation option. It's a bit limited in what it can do natively, but in addition to a 720p mp4, it provides the .ass file used to create it, which can be edited further in a subtitle editor like Aegisub if desired. It's implemented as a collection of multiple smaller tools, so some people that use other software also use pieces of The Tüül, such as the Lyrics tool which can help add syllable slashes by adding to every instance of a word when you add them to one.
