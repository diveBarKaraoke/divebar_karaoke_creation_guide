Take your brand name & use initials or whatever is not taken. 3 is best, 4+ is fine

* C11K

Numbering
---------

Start with 0001, and increment by 1 every song. Any change, such as duets, solos, key changes, with backing vocals, without backing vocals, all get their own track. 

Artist  - Title. Keep it all that way. 

Artist Notes
------------

Anything that has to do with Singing the song, such as it's a duet, or backing vocals go on the artist side

With backing vocals should be (Wbgv), Without backing vocals should be (Wobgv) after the Artist

Any Information you want to add about the song goes at the end, explicit version, alternative lyrics, advanced karaoke version, etc etc

Example:

* BREZ-0040 - Jonathan Coulton - First Of May (Live) (Explicit)

Songs that include another song, such as combining them because they go together should be “Artist - Song+Song”

Artists with “The” in the middle of the name have no change

Songs that are only 2 words remain unchanged, Songs with more than 2 words, move “The” to the end - “, The”

Example:

* Band - The Gold :bdg-success:`Good`

Keep all punctuation - Except commas (excluding “, The”)

Use & for “And”
