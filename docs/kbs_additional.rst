Background Vocal Timing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Guide by Acorlei aka Lone Wolf Karaoke

Listen, I hate it, you hate it, we all hate it, but background vocals are notoriously difficult to time in your syncing. As a result, they often go untimed, or even, (dare I say it?) FIXED. *shudder* Well, there’s a way you too can sync the background vocals with the foreground, so your friends and other patrons can sing along with the lead. But here’s the thing… you’re basically button mashing through the areas that need the sync, and then editing the rest later. Try and keep on time with the lead, so at least that much will be clean when you finish your first sync.

Remember no good track ever was born from laziness.

      As you can see from the first NIFTY little picture here, you can actually stack lyrics on top of each other. The easiest way (if you’re using Karaoke Builder Studio 5), is to Shift-Click a stack which will turn the entire stack gray (see image on the right). Then, just click and drag it to the location it’s supposed to be. If your background vocals overlap with leads… you’re going to have to fix some stuff. But thankfully, each end of a syllable can be dragged to increase or decrease its wiping speed.

      If’n you’re on an earlier version of KBS, I’m so sorry. It’s not nearly as easy; you’ll have to use the dreaded slow-arrows of doom. (See left) 

They’ll get your lyrics where they need to be, but you’re going to be sitting there for about an hour and a half while you wait for THIS PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE NINETIES AND NEVER OPTIMIZED FOR MODERN SYSTEMS EVEN THOUGH IT’S BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED THIRTY YEARS LATER THERE ARE STILL NEXT TO ZERO QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS AND— and I’m cool. Chill out, calm head.

See what I mean? If you’re also going to be having background vocals running while your lead is actively singing, don’t forget to give them a different style.

That way, your lead doesn’t get confused while singing. CTRL-Click the background vocals and make sure their “Line Style” is set to your background. Make sure that the style is distinctive as well, to also prevent confusion. Different colors often help.
