Mac Quick Start

Install Required Software
-------------------------

`Download MidiCo <https://www.midicokaraoke.com/en-b2/midico-download.html>`_ - Choose the version applicable to your Mac type and version.

This is the software we'll use to sync lyrics. It is a paid product, but the evaluation version will be enough for you to test if it will work for you.

Sync Lyrics
-----------

OK, it's finally time to start the graphics.

1. Open MidiCo
2. Go to :menuselection:`Maker --> Open Maker` if the Synchronizer window is not open.
3. Hit the :menuselection:`Edit Lyrics` button.
4. Paste your lyrics into the left pane.
5. Ensure none of the lyrics go over the red bars on either side. If any do, add line breaks as needed.
6. Go to :menuselection:`Maker --> Change Soundtrack` and locate your audio file (either the full audio or vocal stem, not the instrumental).
7. Hit the :menuselection:`Start Sync` button.
8. The audio will start playing. The next syllable/word will be highlighted in red. Hit space on your keyboard when the audio for it plays. If you have the evaluation version, you will only be able to play 2 minutes of the audio.

There are of course some more features available for syncing, as well as editing and layout options, but that's the basics.

Output
------

1. Click :menuselection:`Maker --> Change Soundtrack` again, and locate your instrumental/karaoke audio.
2. Go to :menuselection:`File --> Export to Mp3+Cdg...` to create a CDG.
3. Go to :menuselection:`File --> Export Movie...` to create a video file. With the evaluation copy, your resolution will be limited.

Follow-up steps
---------------
* Learn more about MidiCo Karaoke with some :doc:`background and video tutorials <midico>`.
* View a :doc:`comparison of karaoke software <graphics_software>` to see if any would work better for you.
* Read about :doc:`uvr` to help decide if you'd rather run your vocal isolation locally rather than with x-minus.
* Buy `MidiCo <https://www.midicokaraoke.com/en-a6/buy-license.html>`_ and the `Advanced Video Karaoke Maker plug-in <https://www.midicokaraoke.com/en-b9/buy-plugin.html?plugin=avm>`_ (the plug-in is almost mandatory to do anything useful with MidiCo).
* Purchase a subscription for `x-minus <https://x-minus.pro/ai>`_ (click the link to try Premium)
* Download `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/download/mac/>`_ to edit your audio files if the stems directly from x-minus aren't quite good enough.
* Set up a :doc:`Google Drive <google-drive>` for KJs to use for offline shows.
* :ref:`Apply for a channel <joining:Requesting a Channel>` on the Discord (once you get to 10 videos).
