Feedback/Contributions
======================

There's two places you can request an update to the docs.

One is to create an Issue or Pull Request on GitHub, where the source of the project is managed. <INSERT LINK>

The other is to use this `Google Form <https://forms.gle/EUfW2Q2P2pEVrt9r6>`_ (no login required).

While it's also possible to discuss in the Discord, messages there are easier to miss, so we recommend also following up with a request in one of the above two ways if you do so.

Thanks!
