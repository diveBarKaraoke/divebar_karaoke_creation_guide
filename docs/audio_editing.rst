Audio Editing
=============

Vocal isolation models do a great job separating out lead vocals, but oftentimes some editing is needed to combine parts of different stems, use samples for repeat parts that don't isolate well every time, adjust the levels, etc. There are several great software options available, including some free ones. Here are a few that are recommended:

Audacity
--------

`Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`_ is a free editor that is very capable and has a lot of effects available. One thing to note though is that most of its effects are considered "destructive," meaning that while they can be undone, you can't apply an effect, apply a second effect, then remove the first effect while keeping the second â€“ instead you have to undo both, then reapply the second. It's often possible to work around this by using multiple tracks to experiment with options.

REAPER
--------

`REAPER <https://www.reaper.fm/>`_ is an extremely powerful DAW (digital audio workstation) that has numerous features and plugins available. It is a paid product, but there is a 60-day trial to evaluate it and see if it fits your needs.
