Doblon
======

Doblon makes multiple pieces of karaoke creation software, with overlapping functionality. `CD+G Creator <https://www.powerkaraoke.com/src/prod_karaokecdgcreator.php>`_ only produces CDG karaoke files, and `Karaoke Video Creator <https://www.powerkaraoke.com/src/prod-karaoke-video-creator.php>`_ only produces video. There's also a `CD+G Creator Pro <https://www.powerkaraoke.com/src/prod_karaokecdgcreatorpro.php>`_ that also only produces CDG, but removes some of the limitations in the basic version. Karaoke Video Creator and CD+G Creator Pro can import and export lyric timing, which can presumably then be used in both pieces of software if both formats are desired. They also have a feature to import CDG, which attempts to OCR it back to lyrics and timing, but they are limited in the types of karaoke scrolls that will work with it.

This software offers numerous options to configure the overall style of the karaoke track, and offers built-in support for split-screen duets, but does not have the per-line layout flexibility that something like KBS does, so heavily customized karaoke is not possible. This is also the most expensive option, especially if both the pro version of CD+G Creator Pro and Karaoke Video Creator are needed.
