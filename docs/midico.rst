`MidiCo <https://www.midicokaraoke.com/>`_ is Mac-only karaoke software that supports creation of both video and CDG karaoke. Video is a first-class export target, so it renders text properly in video at up to 4K. If you're on Mac, this is probably your best option.

One thing to note about MidiCo is that it's more expensive than it might initially look. Due to the limitations of the base software, for many people, the Advanced Video Karaoke Maker plugin is a must, and that plugin costs more than the software itself.
