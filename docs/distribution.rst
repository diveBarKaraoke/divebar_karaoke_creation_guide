Distribution
============

Community karaoke creators currently have two main means of distributing their work: :doc:`YouTube <youtube>`, and :doc:`Google Drive <google-drive>` (or similar file upload services).

YouTube is for most of our users - people singing karaoke at home or house parties, using it to practice for an audition, listening to it as background music because it's more calming without the words, etc. YouTube is ubiquitous and easy to access, and the deals Google made with music labels mostly keeps the content online.

To see some guidelines on YouTube usage, see :doc:`youtube`.

Google Drive shares are mostly geared toward a particular type of user: KJs for live shows. To keep the show running smoothly, it's helpful for KJs to have offline copies of songs, and it's not always practical to rip them from YouTube. If you want your files to be easily usable by KJs, it's important to follow some conventions, so your tracks will fit in with the rest of their collection.

See :doc:`google-drive`.
