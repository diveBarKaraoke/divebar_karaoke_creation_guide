Joining the Community
=====================

If you want to join the community of karaoke creators in the diveBar community, our primary method of communication is the `diveBar Discord <https://discord.gg/diveBar>`_. We welcome not only creators, but all karaoke enthusiasts, so feel free to join if you're not there already.

Once there, as you create videos, feel free to post them to `#new-releases <https://discord.com/channels/918644502128885760/964716709057548328>`_. This will likely gain you some subscribers, and you can also request some feedback.
