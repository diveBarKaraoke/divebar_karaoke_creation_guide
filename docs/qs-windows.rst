Windows Quick Start
===================

.. include:: qs-disclaimer.inc

Install Required Software
-------------------------

:download:`Download Karaoke Builder Studio <https://www.karaokebuilder.com/download/kbstudio.exe>`

This is the software we'll use to sync lyrics. It is a paid product, but the free trial will be enough for you to test if it will work for you. Yes, it does look like it's from the 90s, but for now please just trust the process.

.. include:: qs-x-minus.inc

.. include:: qs-lyrics.inc

.. include:: qs-kbs.inc

CDG Output
----------

Once the syncing is complete, you can click the Audio button again and switch the audio to the instrumental track, then hit Build and generate a CDG. You're technically done. Note that if you are using the trial of KBS, the output will not be fully usable, but will be good enough to see that it worked.

.. include:: qs-kbp2video.inc

1. :download:`Download kbp2video <https://itmightbekaraoke.com/kbp2video/current.exe>` and install it.
2. Launch it from the start menu.
3. Drag and drop your .kbp file into it.
4. Hit the Convert to Video button.

Now you should have a kbp2video folder alongside the project and a nice mp4 video file in it.
